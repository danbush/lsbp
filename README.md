# Lies, Spies, and Berry Pies
## Requires
* MongoDB
* Node.js

## To install node on ubuntu or windows 10 bash:
~~~~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
~~~~

## To install Mongo DB
[Go here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community), and follow the instructions.
Open command prompt and run the following command.
~~~~
md \data\db
~~~~
Then cd into the bin folder of the monogodb installation (probably in Program Files) and run the "mongod" exe.
## 
Don't use npm update (at least for now) because it currently needs an older version of mongoose. Use npm install.
